Some ecommerce explorations.

Used this article, Implementing a Web Shopping Cart, by Chris Baron and Bob
Weil, back in 1996 as the basis of an online travel reservations system
implemented in Visual Foxpro using the West Wind Web Connection DLL to interface
with the Windows NT IIS.

Now implementing some of the same stuff with Elixir and Phoenix.

Using the Depot application from "Agile Web Development with Rails, 3rd Edition," as a guide this time.
